# Installing Jsonnet

There are a few implementations of Jsonnet. The most commonly accepted is the `go` implementation. There is also a rust implementation in development.

*The examples have been tested against Jsonnet (Go implementation) v0.20.0 and jrsonnet 0.5.0-pre96*

* Simple: `brew install go-jsonnet`
* Less simple: Follow the Installation Instructions at [github.com/google/go-jsonnet](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet#installation-instructions)
* Rust: Download the appropriate build from the latest dev release, currently [v0.5.0-pre96-test](https://github.com/CertainLach/jrsonnet/releases/tag/v0.5.0-pre96-test)
